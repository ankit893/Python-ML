🛒 E-commerce A/B Testing Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting an A/B testing analysis for an e-commerce company to evaluate whether a new webpage design leads to a higher user conversion rate compared to the existing page. The analysis helps in making data-driven decisions about adopting the new webpage.

🎯 Business Problem
E-commerce companies continuously aim to improve user experience and increase conversion rates. A new webpage design was proposed, and the company wanted to assess its impact before full deployment. The goal was to statistically test whether the new design performs better in terms of user conversion.

❓ Problem Statement
The key challenge was to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in conversion rates between the control group (old webpage) and the treatment group (new webpage). The analysis aims to answer:
Should the company adopt the new webpage design based on improved user conversion rates?

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains user-level information including:

Column Name 	Description

user_id	      Unique identifier for each user

timestamp	    Time of visit

group        	Indicates if user is in control or treatment group

landing_page 	Version of the landing page (old or new)

converted	    Binary indicator (1 = user converted, 0 = not converted)

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python - Data Analysis & Statistical Testing

Pandas - Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn - Visualization

SciPy - Statistical tests

Stats models - Logistic Regression & Hypothesis Testing

Jupyter Notebook - Project development and presentation

📌 Steps Performed

Data Exploration and Cleaning

Checked for duplicate records and inconsistencies

Verified alignment between group and landing page

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized conversion rates across control and treatment groups

Hypothesis Testing

Conducted a Two-Proportion Z-Test to check the significance of conversion rates

Null Hypothesis (H0): Conversion rate is the same for both pages

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The conversion rate is different for the new page

Logistic Regression

Built a logistic regression model to control for confounding variables

Interpreted model coefficients and p-values

📈 Key Insights

No statistically significant difference was found in conversion rates between the control and treatment groups.

Logistic regression also indicated the new page did not outperform the old one.

Recommendation: Please don't switch to the new webpage based on the current analysis.

🧠 Learnings

Developed a strong understanding of A/B testing methodology

Learned how to apply statistical tests to real-world business problems

Gained hands-on experience with hypothesis testing, regression modelling, and interpreting p-values
